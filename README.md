# 🧠 Fake News Detection

A machine learning project that classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using Natural Language Processing and Logistic Regression.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses the power of **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF Vectorization** to detect whether a news article is real or fake. It also incorporates **text preprocessing techniques** using the **NLTK library**, including:

- Lowercasing
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Stemming (PorterStemmer)

The goal is to help users and organizations filter out misleading or false information from legitimate sources.

## 📜 How It Works

1. The user inputs a news article or headline.
2. The input is preprocessed and vectorized using `TfidfVectorizer`.
3. A Logistic Regression model makes the prediction.
4. The prediction is displayed: **REAL** or **FAKE**, with styled output.
